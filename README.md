# Py-Games
This is a repo to store the games I created on python using [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/). I have yet to implement a **requirements.txt** file, but if you try to run a file through the console you should see which libraries you are missing.

## Notes
The game I'm most proud of is [PyGameFirst.py](https://github.com/mparshorov/Py-Games/blob/master/PyGameFirst.py). It's complete with sound and levels of difficulty.
